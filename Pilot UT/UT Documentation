## Reflection
In the test scenario, I found that it was equally challenging for me as a moderater, because I need to be fully aware of the progress of the test and constantly check on the participant. It requires more familiarity with the context and material for the moderator to engage thoroughly in the survey.
The whole process went pretty well because the participant was also a student from this class, which renders their familiarity with the mode of survey. In the real world, this might not be the case, and the test subject might have various issue understanding the tasks. For the survey form, I made a few mistakes here and there and needed to verbally clarify that with the participant, which might have caused even more confusion and affected the test result. In the future, I need to pay more attention to the details in the test by going through the test myself after creating it.
In this way, I would anticipate the issues or confusion that might come up to the the participant.
