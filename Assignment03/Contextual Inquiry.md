Contextual Inquiry (CI)
In the process of learning about my target users, I found that many of my design ideas shifted. I thought it would be interesting to document the before and after of my design challenge and target user definition.

Design Challenge
How might I design an accessible digital experience that shares the histories of Asian Americans and the current issues facing AAPI communities?

My project hopes to support users in their search for narratives that relate to them and to find sources of information on their community. In particular, this project aims to provide Asian Americans with a sense of belonging and solidarity with a community whose history has helped shaped America.

Currently, the sources for historical narratives on Asian Americans is quite scattered online and offline. Because there are so many communities within Asian America, there are many separate websites which aim to serve these specific populations and their needs. There are few websites that consolidate this info in an easily digestible, engaging manner. In person, there are cultural organizations, including museums, that share a similar goal: to showcase the stories of Asian America to the public. However, museums are constrained by their physical location, and sometimes charge entrance fees.

I hope that by digitizing and consolidating these histories, I can make Asian American history more accessible.

Target Users
I want to create a website that empowers the public, including casual consumers and academic researchers, to understand the histories of Asian Americans. Because of its digital nature, users must have access to the internet.

While it is not intended to be a primary source for academic research, it may provide a broad and structured overview on issues in the Asian American literature.

Users would be able to access this collection from anywhere there is internet. On the site, they could navigate chronologically to view events in Asian American history.

Research Methods
To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom.

The session consisted of the following sections:

1. Background questions a. I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.

2. Observation a. I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud. b. When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.

3. Follow-up questions a. These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.
